        <a>
            Of the twenty short piano pieces Brahms published as Opp. 116-119, fourteen are titled “Intermezzo.”  He abandoned the term “Capriccio” after Op. 116.  While an introspective, gentle piece may be implied by “Intermezzo,” it was also used for pieces such as Op. 118, No. 6, whose middle section is very passionate.  Perhaps he considered the term generic enough to suit his needs.  At any rate, the smallest of the four sets, the second, is the only one to use that term exclusively, even in its collective title.  The triptych is notable for the distinct character of the lullaby that permeates all three.  None of them ever gets very loud, and despite a somewhat agitated melancholy in parts of Nos. 2 and 3 (and even the middle section of No. 1), that character is always present.  A tantalizing utterance of Brahms about “cradle songs of my sorrows” has often been associated with the set, but it has never really been clear whether this refers to the set as a whole, to No. 1 in particular, or (as is most likely) to No. 3.  No. 1 is explicitly prefaced with poetic lines about a sleeping child (similar to the “poetic” preface of the slow movement in the F-minor sonata, Op. 5, at the other end of his solo piano output).  Herder’s text for the whole poem fits the beautiful melody perfectly.  The wordless “setting” of a Scottish ballad recalls the “Edward” Ballade, Op. 10, No. 1.  The piece is among the most popular of the late miniatures, both because of this highly memorable tune and because it is relatively easy to play.  Nonetheless, it requires great sensitivity in projecting the melody out from the middle of the texture, where it often lies, in the voicing of the dark middle section, and in the subtle canon toward the end of the reprise.  No. 2 has a slightly more complex form that does not really fit the usual A-B-A model seen in these pieces.  The perpetual flowing lines of the main theme, while somewhat gloomy, are strangely subdued.  The underlying tensions in No. 3, which always seem ready to burst through, never really do, giving the piece an air of resigned, even hopeless tragedy, a “cradle song of sorrow.”  Its slightly extended form is similar to that of Op. 118, No. 6, where the passion does break through.  All three pieces rely heavily on the upbeat, particularly No. 2.  The narrow range of keys, B-flat to E-flat, with C-sharp at the near-midpoint between them, is similar to that seen in Op. 119, where the range is from B to E.
